# First Grep

## Problem

Can you find the flag in [file](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/5f3d01c1753f29c50640a903bd6ec5e6/file)? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way. You can also find the file in /problems/first-grep\_5\_452e1c1630eb14b6753e9a155c3ae588 on the shell server.

## Hint

grep [tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/grep.php)

## Solution

grep the file for "picoCTF" string

## Flag

picoCTF{grep\_is\_good\_to\_find\_things\_887251c6}
