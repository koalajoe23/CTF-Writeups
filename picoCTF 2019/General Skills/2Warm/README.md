## Problem

Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?

## Hint

Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was '11111', you would submit 'picoCTF{11111}' as the flag.

## Solution

Just convert the number to binary:
42 = 1 * 2⁶ + 0 * 2⁵ + 1 * 2⁴ + 0 * 2³ + 1 * 2² + 0 * 2¹ + 1 * 2⁰ = 101010

## Flag

picoCTF{101010}
