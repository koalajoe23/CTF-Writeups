## Problem

To get truly 1337, you must understand different data encodings, such as hexadecimal or binary. Can you get the flag from this program to prove you are on the way to becoming 1337? Connect with nc 2019shell1.picoctf.com 44303.

## Hints

- I hear python can convert things.
- It might help to have multiple windows open

## Solution

The first solution is already printed out and just needs to be parsed from the output.

The second solution is given in octal numbers to look up in the ASCII table.

The third solution is given in hex numbers to look up in the ASCII table.
