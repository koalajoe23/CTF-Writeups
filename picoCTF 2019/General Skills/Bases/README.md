# Bases

## Problem

What does this bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1 mean? I think it has something to do with bases.

## Hint

Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.

## Solution

The string is base64 encoded. Use python to decode it.

## Flag

picoCTF{l3arn\_th3\_r0p35}
