# where-is-the-file

## Problem

I've used a super secret mind trick to hide this file. Maybe something lies in /problems/where-is-the-file\_4\_f26b413d005c16c61f127740ab242b35.

## Hint
- What command can see/read files?
- What's in the manual page of ls?

## Solution

On the SSH server, use "ls -A" to find hidden file ".cant\_see\_me". Use cat on it to obtain the flag

## Flag

picoCTF{w3ll\_that\_d1dnt\_w0RK\_cb4a5081}
