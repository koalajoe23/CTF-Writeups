## Problem

If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII? 

## Hint

Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.

The corresponding entry for 0x70 in the ASCII table is "p"

## Flag

picoCTF{p}
